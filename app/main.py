Kafka Clone - APIVersions Handler

This module implements a simple Kafka broker that supports the ApiVersions request.
It reads incoming requests (which may be sent sequentially on the same connection),
parses the header, discards the request body, and sends back a response.

Supported ApiVersions:
  - Only the ApiVersions API (api_key 18) is processed.
  - The broker supports versions 0 to 4. If the request_api_version is outside this range,
    an error code 35 ("UNSUPPORTED_VERSION") is returned.
    
Response encoding:
  The response is built in Kafka's flexible (compact) message format for ApiVersions v4:
    - error_code: INT16 (2 bytes)
    - api_keys: compact array:
         Length: Unsigned varint (1 byte); for one entry, this equals (1+1)=2.
         Entry: api_key (INT16), min_version (INT16), max_version (INT16), entry TAG_BUFFER (1 byte = 0x00)
    - throttle_time_ms: INT32 (4 bytes, value 0)
    - Response TAG_BUFFER: compact bytes (empty, encoded as 1 byte 0x00)
    
Overall, the response body length is 15 bytes. Since a 4‚Äêbyte correlation id is prepended,
the message length field (the first 4 bytes) is 19.
Combined with the 4-byte message_length field, the total transmission is 23 bytes.

# It will start a server that listens for incoming connections on port 9092.
# The server will process ApiVersions requests and respond accordingly.
# The server will continue running until interrupted or the client closes the connection.
# The server is designed to handle multiple requests from the same client sequentially.
# The server will print logs to the console for each request received and response sent.
# The server will also handle any exceptions that occur during processing and print error messages.
# The server will close the connection gracefully when finished.
# The server is designed to be simple and easy to understand, focusing on the ApiVersions request handling.
# The server is not intended to be a complete Kafka implementation, but rather a simplified version for educational purposes.
# The server is designed to be run in a controlled environment for testing and development purposes.
# The server is not intended for production use and should not be used in a production environment.
